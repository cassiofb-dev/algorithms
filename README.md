# Algorithms
## About
This is a website that I made after 12 days of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
I made this site the most simple and lightest possible so that other code newbies like me can understand easily.
In the JS folder you can see that all the functions are separeted in files so I hope you can help me in it.
